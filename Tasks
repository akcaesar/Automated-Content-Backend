Tasks (or modules that can be developed independently)

1. Module for voice over that takes a block of text as input and output a .wav file (or any other sound format file)

2. Text generator/extractor . Takes a single word or a query which defines the topic of the video and generates text related to that. (Maybe short text so that the final video is <= 10 sec long )
  Can either generate text with some open source LLMs or extracts text from some open source blog.

3. Module for extracting images from some stock free website (through an API). 


4. Module which combines the text and the images. The text is overlayed on top of the sequence of images.


5. Module for Saving / posting the video


6. Module for connecting to Youtube API
